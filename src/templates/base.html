    <!-- define a link to stylesheet with following reference
      a static css folder and the file name is main.css -->
    <!-- first code: not using url_for method
    from template folder, we go up to src folder, then go down to static and css
    href=".." is going up a directory to src folder
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static//css/main.css"/>
    however, this would be problematic if we move the folder to another folder
    we need to update the location for each reference code.-->
    <!-- second code: using url_for method
    because we use Jinja2 for Flask, we ask them to find the folder static for us-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{url_for('static',filename='css/main.css')}}"/>
